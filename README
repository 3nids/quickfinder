**Item Browser** is a [QGIS](http:://www.qgis.org) plugin which allows you to browse a multiple selection.

## Howto

First, connect the layers by clicking the ![plug](https://github.com/3nids/itembrowser/blob/master/icons/connect.png?raw=true) icon
or the corresponding menu entry. Choose the layers to be connected to the plugin and validate.

You can now select features and see in the left side panel of QGIS
a widget dialog in which you can browse your selection. 
The view/edit form can be opened by clicking the ![pen](https://github.com/3nids/itembrowser/blob/master/icons/edit.png?raw=true) icon.

In the settings (accessible in the plugin menu), you can set the color and width of the rubber band, 
and the scaling with respect to the dimension of the bounding box of the current item.

You can also define in the settings, if you want your selection to be saved to the project.
With this function enabled, as soon as you re-open the project or QGIS, the last selection
is reloaded for each connected layers and and also the current item you were browsing.

A demo video is available on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/v/f2-wlgfo1jU&hd=1).

Last version can be found on [github](https://github.com/3nids/itembrowser).

## Python developpers

If you want something to happen with the selection, the connected layer emits two signals as soon as the selection changed:

* _browserCurrentItem(int)_ if there is a selection, the given integer being the feature id.
* _browserNoItem()_ if there is nothing selected.
