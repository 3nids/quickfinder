**Quick Finder** is a [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) plugin as a dockable dialog to quickly find a feature by its ID in a layer or by other attributes.

## QGIS version

Quick Finder is a __QGIS 2.x__ plugin.
There is not port planned for QGIS 3 since most of its features are already accessible:
- indexed search: you can use inbuilt locator filter.
- osm: see nominatim plugin
- geomapfish: see Geomapfish Locator plugin

## Description

You can select, pan, scale and open form for the returned features.

See demo on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/v/bsqMLMqlCYQ&hd=1) (this version is 1.0, some features have been added since)
