**Quick Finder** is a [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) plugin as a dockable dialog to quickly find a feature by its ID in a layer or by other attributes.

You can select, pan, scale and open form for the returned features.

See demo on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/v/bsqMLMqlCYQ&hd=1) (this version is 1.0, some features have been added since)
