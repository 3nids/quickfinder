In the _project search_ tab, create a new file using the _create_ button. This file is related to the current project and should be kept along.\r\n\r\nThen to add a layer search, click on ![add button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3nids/quickfinder/master/icons/add.png). In this dialog, you will define:\r\n* the search name (it will be used to group the results by search name)\r\n* the layer\r\n* the field used for this search (or an expression to combine several)\r\n* priority\r\n\r\nIf checking record entry, the search will be directly indexed on the QuickFinder file. Uncheck this if you want to create several searches on very large layers (from ~100'000 elements). You will be able to index them all at once later.\r\n\r\nSince the searches are indexed on an external file, editing in QGIS the layers will make the indexed file obsolete. You can define a delay after which the plugin will propose you to update the searches.\r\n\r\n### Online remote services\r\n\r\nAt the moment, you can use an Open Street Map and/or a GeoMapFish service.\r\n\r\n### Searching\r\n\r\nA text box is displayed in QGIS toolbars. Use this to search whithin your defined project searches and remote services. All results will be displayed under it.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
